I'm Guillermo[^1], a senior software engineer currently based in Barcelona.

Some of my core beliefs when it comes to tech:

- Fundamentals are underrated.
- Being a good learner may be the most important skill for a software engineer.
- Being a good searcher may be the second most important skill for a software engineer.
- [Things should be more efficient](https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/). This is a solvable, engineering problem.
- Finding the tools that work for you is important. So is mastering them. Using a JetBrains IDE the same way one would use Notepad is wasteful.


If you want to connect for questions, projects, job opportunities, or just to have a chat, you can reach me on the socials linked on the [homepage](/). I don't post my e-mail to avoid drowning in spam. If you don't do LinkedIn, you can try opening an issue [here](https://github.com/guille/guille.github.io/issues/new).
