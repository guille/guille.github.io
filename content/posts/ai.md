It's 2026. I figure it's time to talk about AI.

Let's get some things out of the way first. Leaving aside cult practices, I think the Bay Area Rationalists are philosophically confused. For what it's worth, I think deep down they know this, otherwise [this bet](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2017/01/my_end-of-the-w.html) would have had a much higher payout for Kaplan. Having kids and saving up for retirement are other examples where reality slips in through the cracks.

Beyond the more extreme positions, the next worry seems to be about being replaced. Weirdly enough, this worry seems more vocal in the software engineer position.

After a few years of changing the definition of AGI to adjust stakeholders expectations,...

people swearing by 10x improvement (!) started appearing in 2023 and 2024. I have not seen a single product that came out in those years that looks like it has been developed and polished for ten or twenty years.

i don't spend that much time writing code?

Switch abstraction one level up? Fine.


> Matt Godbolt’s rule. You should know your layer well, but you should also know one layer below it a little bit, and you definitely need to know the shape of the layer that’s beneath that.

It is not a coincidence that technical engineering managers get better results.


While many of the technical advancements that made LLMs possible are incredibly impressive, most of the tools downstream of that are... underwhelming. Wrappers around markdown files, calling Claude Code inside a do-while loop is being touted as a revolutionary breakthrough.

Other email jobs are going first? First adopter perspective is just eerier.
C-suite wet dream, get rid of all that costly opex.

Care about results, not how to get there. If someone said they don't use Google at all. No Stack Overflow, no online docs. They just have a copy of the C manual behind them and go reference it. If they're efficient enough at their task... do you care? Why? Credit mandates are stupid. Then again, for most people that's insane. AI is the path of least resistance, but PMs being able to google "how to switch those columns around" was already a thing, friction is just lowered.
