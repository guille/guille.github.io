**1)** *[Reflections on a decade of coding](https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/reflections-on-a-decade-of-coding/)* was a great read—especially the *[Coding](https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/coding/)* section. On a similar vein, [reading grug](https://grugbrain.dev/) is always a good idea.


**2)** I like reading about security vulnerabilities. For the most part. I came out of [this write-up](https://www.evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems-via-CUPS-Part-I/) terrified and swearing off CUPS forever. In case you think I'm exaggerating, here is a [follow-up](https://x.com/evilsocket/status/1879846515180511705).

**3)** Writing a calculator app is easy, until you think about it. And the more you think about it, the harder it gets. [Here's an amazing writeup on the stock Android calculator](https://chadnauseam.com/coding/random/calculator-app).

**4)** [This Xwitter thread](https://archive.ph/29DfU) was painful to read but I think very enlightening. It's really a cautionary tale about how big businesses work and how bad most engineers are at navigating it!

> fixing anything was requiring major surgery, even just the metrics. i spent a couple months thinking i was being challenged and growing as an engineer until i saw something so stupid it triggered a crisis of faith

> "we built a new service" is news that travels further up the org chart than "we changed the addressing scheme so the primary key index actually works"

**5)** These "[Debugging strategies](https://stephenmalina.com/post/2025-03-23-debugging-strategies/)" are useful. Debugging is one of the most important skills programmers develop, and getting better at it tends to result in massive performance improvements!

**6)** Here are some videos and explainers I've found useful for grokking LLMs better:

- [3Blue1Brown visualisations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi), 8-video course on neural networks.
- Spreadsheets continue being one of the most versatile tools invented. Why not use them to [learn about AI](https://spreadsheets-are-all-you-need.ai/)?

	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvZN3-WqAOI
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6yD5SOxOXI

These come recommended but I haven't had the time to go through them yet:
- https://www.understandingai.org/p/large-language-models-explained-with
- https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/

**9)** And finally, a couple of links in the very popular "how I use LLMs" sub-genre that I found particularly insightful.

- https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-use-llms/
- https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/

> My current favorite mental model is to think of them as an over-confident pair programming assistant who’s lightning fast at looking things up, can churn out relevant examples at a moment’s notice and can execute on tedious tasks without complaint.
