**1)** A few hours after I wrapped up the last roundup I learned about CVE-2024-3094. It's a fascinating —and terrifying— situation: a vulnerability was intentionally introduced by one of the core maintainers of `xz` over a couple of years. It was randomly discovered by pure luck, and one wonders what other issues are out there like this. And also, who was behind it. Read more at *[Everything I Know About the Xz Backdoor](https://boehs.org/node/everything-i-know-about-the-xz-backdoor)*.

**2)** Lots of great advice over at *[How To Efficiently Advance Your Software Engineering Career](https://jakeseliger.com/2023/10/11/how-to-efficiently-advance-your-software-engineering-career-guest-post/)*. The title sounds click-baity but it's really not. I guess for some people it will be obvious, but for me it was useful.

**3)** *[A Grand Unified Theory of the AI Hype Cycle](https://blog.glyph.im/2024/05/grand-unified-ai-hype.html)*. In my view, we're on step 7, closing in on 8. For anyone interested in a book-length treatment of the topic, I enjoyed *[The Myth of Artificial Intelligence: Why Computers Can’t Think the Way We Do](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55503081-the-myth-of-artificial-intelligence)*, although it is not without faults.

**4)** Presented without further comment, *[Game of Life, simulating itself, infinitely zoomable](https://oimo.io/works/life/)*
